# Credit-Risk-Analysis
### Introduction:
This assignment focuses on applying Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to a real business context. It involves utilizing EDA techniques to gain insights into risk analytics in the banking and financial services sector, specifically how data can mitigate the risk of lending to customers.

### Business Understanding:
In this scenario, we work for a consumer finance company specializing in lending to urban customers. The goal is to use EDA to analyze data patterns, ensuring that applicants capable of repaying loans are not unfairly rejected.

The company must make loan approval decisions based on two key risks:

Risk of not approving a loan to a creditworthy applicant, resulting in lost business.
Risk of approving a loan to an applicant likely to default, leading to financial losses.

### Data Description:
The data contains loan application information, categorized into two scenarios:

Clients with payment difficulties (e.g., late payments on the first Y installments).
All other cases with payments made on time.
Loan application decisions can fall into four categories:

Approved: Loan application approved.
Cancelled: Applicant canceled the application during approval.
Refused: Loan application rejected.
Unused offer: Loan canceled at different stages.


### Business Objectives:
This case study aims to identify patterns indicative of clients having difficulty repaying installments. These patterns can inform actions like loan denial, reducing loan amounts, or offering loans to risky applicants at higher interest rates. The ultimate goal is to ensure that creditworthy consumers are not unfairly rejected.

The company seeks to understand the key variables driving loan defaults and utilize this knowledge for portfolio management and risk assessment.
